# Introduction
I had the task of finding Tor bridges and checking their functionality automatically since almost all Internet resources are blocked in my country, but I did not find a tool on Github that could do all the actions for me (maybe I was looking poorly). After that I decided to write this script myself. Perhaps this script is the only one that performs this task.
# Installation
To start, clone the repository or download the source code from this link: https://github.com/seratclemency/Tor-bridges-parser/archive/refs/heads/main.zip, unzip the archive, call the terminal in the directory, install dependencies with this command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` then run main.py using this command: ```python main.py```
